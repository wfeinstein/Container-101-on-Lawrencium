# Lawrencium Cluster Overview
<center><img src="figures/lrc.png" width="80%"></center>

# Lawrencium Condo Cluster
- Lawrencium is a LBNL Condo Cluster Computing resources
    - Significant investment from LBNL
    - Individual PIs purchase nodes and storage
    - Computational cycles are shared among all lawrencium users
- Share the same supercluster infrastructure: 
    - OTP authentication
    - High speed infiniBand parallel file system for fast inter-node communication
    - OS and security updates, software module farm, job scheduler SLURM
    - Home/project storage, lustre parallel file system and backend network infrastructure.

# Three types of Project Accounts
- PI Computing Allowance (PCA) account: free 300K SUs per year (pc_xxx)
- Condo account: 
    - PIs purchase and contribute compute nodes to the general condo pool (lr_xxx)
    - Run jobs within their condo contributions for free 
- Recharge account: with minimal recharge rate ~ $0.01/SU (ac_xxx)
- $25 per user per month 
- Refer to detailed information at [here](https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/hpc/getting-an-account
)

## User accounts
- User account request

- *module list*: check currently loaded software 
- Users may install their own software
- More [information](https://sites.google.com/a/lbl.gov/high-performance-computing-services-group/getting-started/sl6-module-farm-guide)

# Jub Submission
- sbatch: submit a job to the batch queue system
```sbatch myjob.sh```

```srun -A ac_xxx -p lr5 -q lr_normal -t 1:0:0 --pty bash```
- salloc : request an interactive node(s)
 	```salloc –A pc_xxx –p lr6 –q lr_debug –t 0:30:0```

# Job Monitoring
- sinfo:view information about partitions and nodes (idle, allocated, drain, down ) 
 ```sinfo –r –p lr6```
- squeue: check the current jobs in the batch queue system
	```squeue –u $USER```
- sacct: information on jobs
	```sacct -X -o ‘jobid,user,partition,nodelist,stat’```
- scancel : cancel a job
 	```scancel jobID```

# Containerization
- Technology of putting an application and all of its dependencies into a single package.
- Portable, shareable, and reproducible.
- Your application brings its environment with it.

# Containerization Examples
- Package an analysis pipeline so that it runs on your laptop, in the cloud, and in a high performance computing (HPC) environment to produce the same result.
- Publish a paper and include a link to a container with all of the data and software that you used so that others can easily reproduce your results.
- Install and run an application that requires a complicated stack of dependencies with a few keystrokes.
- Create a pipeline or complex workflow where each individual program is meant to run on a different operating system.

# Container vs. Virtual Machine

# Singularity Technology
- Open-source computer software that encapsulates an application and all its dependencies into a single image
- Bring containers and reproducibility to scientific computing and HPC
- Developed by Greg Kurtzer
- Singularity assumes that you will have a build system where you are the root user, but that you will also have a production system where you may or may not be the root user.

# Singularity Workflow
- Install Singularity on a local machine
- Build Singularity images/containers on the local machine
- Transfer images/containers to LRC clusters
- Run images /containers on the cluster
    - Root privilege is not permitted 
    
# Install Singularity
Three OS platforms: 
    - Linux
    - Mac
    - Window
Installation [instructions]()
```
$ singularity --version 
$ singularity run docker://godlovedc/lolcow
```

# Create Singularity Containers
- Directly from existing containers 
    - [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=image) 
    - [Sylabs Cloud](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library) and [Singularity hub](https://singularity-hub.org/) 
    - [Nvidia HPC containers](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/gpu-cloud/containers/)
    - [Biocontainers](https://biocontainers.pro/#/registry)
    - [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/available-deep-learning-containers-images/)

- Build from a definition file or recipes 

# Singularity pull
- No root/sudo privilege is needed
- Create immutable squashfs containers
```singularity pull --help```
- Docker Hub:  Pull a container from Docker Hub.
```
singularity pull docker://ubuntu:18.04 
singularity pull docker://gcc:7.2.0
```
- Singularity Hub:  If no tag is specified, the master branch of the repository is used
```singularity pull shub://singularityhub/hello-world```

# Singularity shell, run, exec
- **shell** sub-command: invokes an interactive shell within a container
```singularity shell hello-world_latest.sif```

- **run** sub-command: executes the container’s runscript
```singularity run hello-world_latest.sif ```

- **exec** sub-command: execute an arbitrary command within container 
```singularity exec hello-world_latest.sif cat /etc/os-release```

# Singularity build
- Root/sudo privilege is needed
```singularity build --help```
- Build from a definition file
```sudo singularity --debug build mycontainer.sif Singularity ```

# Defination files (recipts)
```

%help
Hello. I'm in the container.
# executed on host after the base OS is installed.

    touch ${SINGULARITY_ROOTFS}/tacos.txt
    echo “I love avocado” >> avocados.txt

# copy files from your host system into the container 
%files
    avocados.txt /opt

# Singularity build a rewritable sandbox
```
sudo singularity build --sandbox build test-box Singularity 
sudo singularity build --sandbox build gccbox docker://gcc:7.2.0
```
- Can be built from a recipe or existing image 
- Used to develop, test, and make changes, then build or convert it into a standard image
- When you want to alter your image, you can use commands like shell, exec, run, with the --writable option
`sudo singularity shell --writable test-box```
- Convert a sandbox to an immutable final image:
```sudo singularity build test-box.sif test-box```

To check how a images is built, running script and environment variables. 
	
# Inspect containers  
```
singularity inspect [options] image_name
    --lablels
    --runscript
    --deffile
    --environment
```

# Singularity Python (spython)
- Python API for Singularity containers
```

```

# Run Singularity containers on Lawrencium
- File transfer to LRC cluster
```scp xxx.sif $USER@lrc-xfer.lbl.gov:/your/path ```
- Run your container interactively
	- Request an interactive compute node
	-```singularity shell/run/exec container.sif```
- Submit a slurm job 

# Job Submission Example
```
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --job-name=container-test		 
#SBATCH --partition=lr5			 
#SBATCH --account=ac_xxx		 
#SBATCH --qos=lr_normal			
#SBATCH --nodes=1			
#SBATCH --time=1-2:0:0			

cd $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR
singularity exec your-container-name.sif CMD PARMs
```

# Container binging points


# Run a GPU container
```singularity shell --nv --bind ${CUDA_HOME} ...```
